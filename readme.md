# C2 Traffic detector
Script to detect C2 traffic of malware using a DGA Algorithm. Malware using a DGA algorithm generates a lot of domain names which it will try to contact which is called Domain Fluxing. This generates a lot DNS Queries resulting in a NXDomain. Because these domain names are generated they have a high "entropy". This script will extract NXDomains by source IP from the given pcap. And will calculate the randomness of the domain name with Shannon or with the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence. The scripts will give an alerts if there is a suspicion of malware trying to connect to a C2 server by domain fluxing. 
 
## Setup
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
 
 ## Usage
`./detector.py $parameters$` 
 
 ## Parameters
 `-f, --file | input pcapfile`
 `-c, --count | Amount of suspisious nxdomains with given entropy before an alert is given, defaults to 5`
 `-e, --entropy | Entropy algorithm used, kl or shannon, defaults to shannon`
 `-et, --entropy_treshold | Entropy Treshold`
 `-t, --time_frame | Time treshold in seconds, defaults to 60`
 `-v, --verbose | Verbose output`

 ## Example
`./detector.py -f test.pcap -c 5 -e kl -et 1.05 -t 300 -v`
